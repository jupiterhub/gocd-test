# Jupiter's Conclusion
- GoCD wins by applying the concept of "fan-in" and "fan-out" easily. Fanning simply means that if and only if all dependencies are satisfied will you get a build scheduled.    

Other build tools such as Jenkins/Hudson and the likes can do this but it is much easier to manage in GoCD with the help of Value Stream Maps.
